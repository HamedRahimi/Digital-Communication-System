# Digital-Communication-System
This scenario includes two transmitter and receiver nodes. The transmitter node, first, samples the physical data such as temperature to turn it to the digital data by Arduino Nano and the DHT11 sensor. Then, this digital data is quantized and encoded, which assign a 6-bit binary to the data. After that, the binary data is sent to the LabVIEW program on a computer by serial communication. On LabVIEW program, the Python (or Matlab) Integration Toolkit encrypts this 6-binary data code and converts it to 16-bits code with the AES algorithm based on the chosen key. Finally, the16-binary code is returned back by the serial link to the controller. After the pipeline coding with the GFSK modulation (the Gaussian FSK), the transmitter sends the data to the receiver node. In the receiver node, after receiving the signal, the controller sends the received data to the computer through serial communication. Then the data is decrypted to the 6-bit data code by using the same key selected by the Python (or Matlab) Integration Toolkit of the sender in the LabVIEW program. Finally, this data is restored to the computer and displayed on LCD.
